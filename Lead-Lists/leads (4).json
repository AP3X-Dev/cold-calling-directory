When it came time to the service the servicemen were professional and kind and you could tell they used a teamwork approach. This company made the process easy with great communication and was honest in expectations. I only searched one time on Google pressure washing companies near me and used the first one that popped up. I‚Äôm glad it was you guys as I didn‚Äôt look further based on the reviews and what I saw already online from this company.

From the moment we spoke with Vicky on the phone to when Jared the owner came by, we realized they would be high on our list. They have a great website that explains their whole process. Jared came to us and spent at least 45 minutes further explaining how he would approach our particular job. He did use Google maps to get a feel for the size of the paver and brick surfaces we wanted washed, sanded and sealed, but also took more exact measurements on site for a more accurate proposal.\nThey worked with us on scheduling and rescheduling due to rain. Kevin and Justin arrived right on time and spent the next 8 hours pressure washing our driveway, walkways, 2 patio areas and brick pool deck. They then \"sanded\" all our pavers and finally put down the sealer. It all looks brand new. Kevin and Justin couldn't have been nicer or more professional. They took my constant \"supervision\" in stride. I only saw them take a short break for lunch. Really knowledgeable, hard workers.\nI highly recommend this company. BJolley. Safety harbor, FL",

We had a tropical storm right after the cleaning and he offered to come back and do a touch-up rinse for a small fee which I appreciated. He even proactively went out of his way to remove a large tree limb that had fallen. That was above and beyond! I highly recommend David (and Gary who is his right-hand).",

Stephen got back to me very quickly and made an appointment to come by and check out the job. He recommended that we do a soft wash versus a pressure wash so that we made sure to not damage any of the boards. He was able to give me a quote on the spot and I made a decision a couple of days later and then he was able to get me scheduled in by the end of the week. I would definitely use Make it Rain Pressure washing in the future and big thanks to Stephen for his great work!!",

        "text": "We can‚Äôt begin to say enough nice things about our experience with Hydro Force Exterior Pressure Cleaning, as this was truly an outstanding interaction from start to finish.\nOur twelve unit condominium association was gathering bids to have our common area driveways, sidewalks, and street gutters pressure washed. We had had some less than stellar experiences with some of these companies in the past, and were looking for firms with a focus on customer satisfaction and attention to detail. We saw Hydro Force listed with positive reviews on Google, Angie‚Äôs List, and Home Advisor so we decided to ask them to bid on our project. After filling out the contact information requesting a free estimate on their web site, we received a call back from Tom, the owner, within thirty minutes and this was on Super Bowl Sunday! After describing our project to Tom, he told us he would be by on Monday afternoon to look at the job and give us an estimate. True to his word, Tom called on Monday afternoon to say he was on the way, and arrived within thirty minutes. He walked the entire property and took measurements for everything we wanted done. He showed us his insurance information as well as before and after pictures of other jobs Hydro Force had done, and explained what would be done at our location. By Monday evening we had Tom‚Äôs bid for our job.\nOur Board of Directors voted to accept the Hydro Force bid based on their presentation and professionalism. While it was not the lowest bid, it was very competitive and that factored into our decision. We agreed on a start date and time for the project and on the appointed date Tom and his wife Connie, arrived ten minutes early and proceeded to go to work. They worked from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, stopping only briefly for lunch. Their attention to detail is absolutely first rate, and customer focus is obviously a priority.\nLet us finish by saying that if you are contemplating a project involving pressure washing, whatever it might be, you really should at least get a bid from Tom at Hydro Force. Professional, Punctual, and Priced right. We will definitely be using them again in the future.",

        "text": "Having just read Kyle's reviews, I'm happy to hear others have not had our experience in working with him and his wife. We accepted Kyle's proposal to clean, repair, re-sand and reseal our pavers on the pool deck on Feb 6, 2024. They walked off the job yesterday, May 24, 2024,  leaving quite a mess for us to clean up. This was not the first time they did this.\n\nWhen they first started, they pressure washed the pool deck, re-sanded and put a coat of sealer on over the old sealer which bled through the new sealer in splotches of white areas. Kyle appeared to be confused, but admitted that they should have stripped the old sealer before applying the new sealer. In a series of fits and starts, they attempted to strip the old sealer. In the process they washed approximately 50 lbs of sand into the swimming pool. We paid Pinch a Penny $150 to vacuum it out.\n\nAt the same time, there were several areas where pavers needed to be leveled and reset. Although Kyle agreed to do this, he never did and when I asked him about it he said some were too difficult and he didn't remember agreeing to fix the others. It didn't get done. They also washed sand into the tracks of our sliding glass doors and hurricane shades, and sprayed sand onto patio furniture, our grill, and onto plants in the planters and left us to take care of it. When we asked them to take care of it, they seemed insulted and from that point on Kyle has behaved like a petulant child.\n\nLater, after weeks of not showing up because they had pushed other jobs ahead of ours, they pressure washed the pavers again and applied a stripper. Both sand and stripper were dumped into the pool. The pool water turned a bright green that has been very difficult to correct. We're still at it. They also killed a large plant and other plants have been compromised but look like they will survive.\n\nIn all cases, when I mentioned these issues to Kyle or offered some alternative approaches, he did not accept any responsibility, only offered excuses, or in most cases, no response all at.\n\nAgain, after over of month of the project being incomplete, they came on the 23rd and 24th to re-sand again and reseal. I had to insist that they protect the channels for the hurricane shades from sand intrusion, which earlier had caused them to not raise and lower correctly. I also asked them to be careful about getting sand and chemicals into the pool, but they either ignored my request of were unable to accomplish it. We have had to treat the pool with a product called First Aide and clean the filter almost daily.\n\nWhen they walked off the job yesterday, again a big mess for us to take care of. You can see that in the photos. Water bottles, paper towels, steel wool and 5 gallon buckets were left scattered around our yard and into planters. They left all of the plastic and tape used to protect the hurricane shades and pool deck drains.\n\nKyle gives a good first impression, but be careful, make sure you put everything in writing and inspect everything before they leave the work site each day. Best, however, to go with another company.",
