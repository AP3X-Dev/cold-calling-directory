They were quick and courteous and I had an appointment within a week. Their team showed up on time and got to work. They got my house, driveway, sidewalks and back patio. They even managed to get some of the spots on my siding that I've never been able to get out myself. The team was friendly and efficient, communicated any spots they thought might be trouble. I had forgotten to move some of my yard decorations out of the way and they moved them to a safe spot, cleaned and then put them back where they found them. When they left my property was shining and there was no damage to my yard or anything. 10/10 will be using them again next year.",

This year, I was charged a service fee before the service was performed. When I called to inquire about the charge, I discovered that no one had contacted me to schedule a service date. We arranged a date during that call.\n\nHowever, about two weeks later, I received a call informing me that they couldn't perform the service unless I paid an additional amount of money, which was a 59% increase. I expressed that charging customers before the service is performed is inappropriate. The customer service representative was rude, and when I requested a refund, I was told that refunds are not typically provided but that she would speak to her supervisor.\n\nThis experience was unprofessional and not the way to conduct business. Consequently, I have canceled my membership and am now waiting for my refund.",

From start to finish, the team was professional, on time, and paid great attention to detail.\n\nThey started with a thorough cleaning that brought the pavers back to life, then carefully re-sanded the joints to ensure everything was solid and even. The sealing job gave the entire area a rich, clean look and really brought out the natural color of the stone.\n\nThe crew was respectful of my property, worked efficiently, and left everything spotless when they finished. I would absolutely recommend Orlando Soft Wash to anyone looking to restore or maintain their pavers. It made a huge difference in the overall appearance of my backyard!\n\n— Cody C.",

I have run operations at a VP level for some large restaurant chains and we called employees like Rudy Hypo's meaning High Potential, someone that will go somewhere and he is one of them.  I asked him to come over after the job I saw him do for my neighbor and quote to wash my roof of my enclosed room over next to the pool. He did an amazing job but time  And the Florida Sun had taken its toll on the roof and the paint had dried to almost a powder leaving just bare aluminium. I said to him well I guess I need to get coated and he said he had experience painting and I asked him if it was something that he would do He said yes that he felt comfortable his experience in painting was good and he would be able to do the job. He gave me a very fair quote showed up on time and he did an amazing job!  I would recommend him for any job that you have is he is not the type of person that will say he can do something and then try to figure it out hes very honest and works very hard you will be very pleased with anything that he does for you! The pictures are the after he cleaned the roof which was all black mold, dirt and flaking paint... As you can see in the after pictures he did a great job painting it and the sealer paint for that job is very tricky because it's thick and has to be applied evenly and thick and he did a great job as you can see!",

My daughter had gotten paint overspray in the driveway.  Of the 3 companies I called, Harrison's Pressure Washing was the only one who was reasonably affordable, guaranteed paint removal, and could do the job on short notice during the Holidays.  Was also thoroughly impressed with the work that Mr. Graham did.  See attached the before and after pictures, it's like the paint was never there and the driveway looks brand new!  I highly recommend Mr. Graham and Harrison's Pressure Washing for any and all of your power washing needs.  You will not beat his price or his excellent customer service when compared to other companies in the area.",

My house and roof have never looked better. Trevean was professional, punctual, and went above and beyond. I will definitely use Magic Touch again.\n\n★★★★★ David Reyes (3 months ago): Magic Touch/Trevean was very professional and well spoken. He cleaned our roof and solar panels. Great value with great work and will be using his services for my driveway. Thank you Trevean! 🙏\n\n★★★★★ Will Weatherford (2 months ago): Great service and attention to our property and neighbors! Highly recommend if you need PW services that last.",
