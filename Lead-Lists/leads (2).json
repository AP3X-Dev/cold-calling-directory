        "text": "Liquid Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite) or Calcium Hypochlorite (pool shock) is commonly used in Power Washing throughout the USA. Chlorine is a good option in removing Mold, Mildew, Algae and Bacteria. It is also relatively Cost-Effective but considering the Cons of using Chlorine when power washing:\nRisk of Damage to Siding, Chlorine can Bleach or Strip your Paint, can damage wood fibers, oxidize aluminum and Damage your Landscaping. Chlorine is toxic to plants, grass and shrubs.\nI paid Jax Pro $300 dollars for power washing my house 3,200 sq ft 2 stories. Job was finished in 1 and a half hour, probably less. The smell of chlorine raised a flag but it wasn't until 4 month later that I realized that the damage was done and the grass will not grow back. We have irrigation system and we fertilize a lot along the year. This is what your lawn will look like when chlorine contaminates your house surroundings, all grass around my house is now dry dead. Re-planting new Sod is the only solution for this. This is what you get around your house when using chlorine on power washing at the wrong concentration (typically ranges from 0.5% - 2.0%). The owner Travis Higgs offered me a solution to fix the problem, but I am still waiting. As an adviser, take your security cameras out of the way before the power washing starts. We have 5 Ring Cameras and all 5 were gone (including the Door Ring), we had to dry'em all and restart everything, took me more than 24 hours to bring everything back. Honestly, I will neither use nor recommend this method of Power Washing to anyone.",

In the worst heat ever, Renard and William worked their tails off to get it looking as best as they possibly could. I understood that rust can be tricky after speaking with David (owner), so my expectation was that it would be 60 to 75% better. I was incorrect. They treated it with acid three maybe four times and it’s now it’s 95% better and I’m happy with that! Considering the cost of the chemicals and the labor, I felt $200 was very reasonable. They also got some hard water stains off my house and sprayed off my front porch as a courtesy.\n\nPlease enjoy these very satisfying before and after photos:",

They brought state-of-the-art equipment and ensured that the entire process was efficient and thorough. The attention to detail was impeccable—no corner of the driveway was left untouched. Even stubborn oil stains and moss buildup that I thought would never come off were completely erased.\n\n**Professionalism:**\nSea Coast pressure washing was professional and polite, taking the time to explain the process and answer any questions I had. They were careful around landscaping and property, making sure not to cause any damage. The job site was left spotless, with no debris left behind.\n\n**Pricing:**\nCompared to other companies, their pricing was competitive, and I felt I got incredible value for my money. They offer transparent pricing with no hidden fees, and the final cost was exactly as quoted.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results were spectacular! My driveway looks brand new. It’s brighter, cleaner, and has a much more inviting appearance now. The curb appeal of my home has improved dramatically.\n\n**Overall Experience:**\nI would highly recommend Sea Coast Pressure Washing to anyone in need of a driveway cleaning service.

We hired them to clean the entire outside walls and windows of our home along with our patio (deck, walls, ceiling and screens). Now our home simply sparkles, it’s so clean. We were sure we needed to have our gutters and garage door painted, but not any more; they look beautiful. Some of the extras thrown in at no cost were some roof cleaning where mildew was starting to form, white vinyl fence cleaning, making our small storage shed look new again, and doing an utterly superb job of cleaning the pool and AC equipment area (it was a mess).

We called about getting our driveway and sidewalk pressure washed. I expected that he would come out the next day and provide an estimate and book us for a later date to clean the driveway and sidewalk when he was available. He ended up calling us back to say he could squeeze us in at the end of his day (the very same day we called). The driveway and sidewalk now look amazing and the price was super fair. On top of that, when he was finished with the job, he went WAY above and beyond by getting rid of some wasp nests on our front porch. If you need something pressure washed, look no further than KleanView. Mr. Spencer is the most hardworking and professional man for the job!",

Whether it’s siding, gutters, concrete, or honestly anything that needs to be cleaned, he handles it with skill, professionalism, and timeliness.\n\nWhat sets Mr. Brown apart is not just the quality of his work, but his professional dialogue, his prompt communication, and how flexible he is with scheduling. Life gets busy, but he’s always quick to respond and ready to work around what we need.\n\nHe’s truly been our go-to for nearly a decade. If reliability had a face, it would be Mr. Brown pulling up with the pressure washer truck. Highly recommend, because consistency like this is rare!",

He explained the entire process and answered all my questions, which gave me complete confidence in his work.\n\nThe soft wash service Chad provided was top-notch. He was punctual, respectful of the property, and delivered amazing results. My home looks refreshed and clean without any of the damage that can come from high-pressure washing. It’s clear Chad cares about doing the job right and treating customers well.\n\nHighly recommend Wash Wizard for anyone in need of expert, reliable exterior cleaning services in Jacksonville!",

We waited for years and our house was really dirty.  I was surprised when the owner only needed an afternoon.  He came and in a few hours—with no damage—our house looks like it did when it was new.  If only I could find more people like this to help with other needs at my home!  What fantastic work and what remarkable equipment.  I can’t recommend this highly enough.  I’ve already set a reminder to call Wash Wizard back in a year.  Don’t worry about damage—this guy is a professional.",
