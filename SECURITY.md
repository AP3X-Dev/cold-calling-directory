# Security Policy

## üîí Data Privacy and Security

This application is designed with privacy and security in mind:

### **Local Data Storage**
- All data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- You have complete control over your data

### **API Keys and Sensitive Information**
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Sample data files** may contain API keys and should be kept private
- **Lead-Lists folder** is excluded from git to prevent accidental exposure

## üö® Important Security Notes

### **Google Maps API Keys**
If you're using Google Places API data:
1. **Remove API keys** from any JSON files before sharing
2. **Use environment variables** for API keys in production
3. **Restrict API key usage** in Google Cloud Console

### **Sample Data**
- Sample lead files may contain real business information
- Keep sample data private and don't share publicly
- Remove or anonymize data before sharing code

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### **For Developers**
1. **Never hardcode API keys** in source code
2. **Use .env files** for sensitive configuration
3. **Add sensitive files** to .gitignore
4. **Review commits** before pushing to ensure no secrets are included

### **For Users**
1. **Keep your data private** - don't share lead lists publicly
2. **Use strong passwords** for any accounts
3. **Regularly backup** your data using the export feature
4. **Be cautious** when importing data from unknown sources

## üìã Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email** the maintainers privately
